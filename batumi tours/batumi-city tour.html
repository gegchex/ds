                            <p>Since the Roman times, Batumi Port has been a key point in the maritime network. From 1878 to 1885, the status of "Porto-Franco" (freeport) played a significant role in the development of the city not only the port. The city and port expanded rapidly, primarily driven by the transport of oil from Baku, which spurred improvements in infrastructure. Prominent figures like the Nobel family, Rothschild, Samuel (founder of “Shell”), and Mantashev contributed to the port’s growth and modernization. Today, Batumi Port continues to serve as an important link in the Eurasian transport corridor, connecting Europe and Asia and supporting various cargo and passenger needs.</p>

                                <p>Europe Square in Batumi is a charming mix of history and modern life, known for its beautiful XIX-XX century architecture.

One of the eye-catching landmarks of the square is Astronomical Clock, crafted in Germany in 2010. The clock displays not only the time but also the positions of the sun and moon, moon phases, and the time of sunrise and sunset. Europe Square is surrounded with hotels, restaurants, and cafes where visitors can relax and enjoy local and European cuisine. It is also a lively hub for events, hosting New Year celebrations, Christmas markets, concerts, and the Batumoba festival (the day of the city-Batumi), making it a vibrant part of the city’s culture.</p>

                                <p>Batumi Cathedral, originally built as a Catholic church in 1903, stands as a testament to the city’s rich and diverse history. Commissioned by the prominent Zubalashvili brothers, Georgian Catholic businessmen, this religious center was designed by renowned Polish architect Aleksander Rogojski in the striking Gothic Revival style: Its towering spires and intricate details evoke a sense of grandeur and timeless beauty. During the Soviet era, the cathedral was closed and repurposed into a high-voltage laboratory, a stark contrast to its original intent. However, in 1989, this historic building found new life when it was transferred to the Georgian Orthodox Church, restoring its spiritual role and reconnecting it to Batumi's religious and cultural heritage.</p>

It was commissioned in 1866 by Aslan Beg Khimshiashvili, a Muslim Georgian nobleman. The mosque’s golden dome and white minaret stand out, contributing to Batumi’s multicultural urban environment. The entrance is adorned with carved doors featuring Georgian motifs, including vine patterns and yellow flowers. The building’s exterior is plastered and painted white, while the interior boasts colorful, detailed paintings by artists from Lazistan, reflecting the region's artistic heritage. After being closed during the Soviet era, the Batumi Mosque underwent renovations in the 1990s, including the construction of a new minaret in 1995. Today, it continues to serve as a vital center for the Muslim spiritual and cultural activities in the city.</p>

                                <p>Designed by architect Semion Vulkovich, Batumi Synagogue was completed in 1904. The architect drew inspiration from the elegant synagogues of Amsterdam and The Hague, resulting in a building that stood as a testament to architectural beauty and cultural significance. For over two decades, the synagogue was a vibrant center for the Ashkenazi Jewish community in Batumi. However, in 1929, the Soviet government repurposed it for use by various sports organizations, shifting its role from a place of worship to a venue for athletic activities. The history of the building took a positive turn in 1993 when it was returned to the Jewish community. After undergoing restoration, it reopened as a synagogue in 1998. In 2011, the synagogue was recognized as a cultural heritage site. Today, the synagogue continues to serve small but active Jewish community of Batumi. It also draws visitors from Israel and around the world.</p>

                                <p>In 1879 the Armenian Apostolic Holy Church, known as Surb Prkich, was established in Batumi through the efforts of Priest - Konstandin Ter-Stepanyan. The original wooden structure quickly proved insufficient, prompting the construction of a new building. But due to financial challenges, construction faced significant delays and extended over a quarter of a century. In 1899, designed by Austrian architect - Robert Marfeld the new church was completed. It was constructed from durable burnt brick in the cross-domed architectural style. During the Soviet era, the church was repurposed first, as a movie rental warehouse and later, as an astrophysical observatory. After the Soviet Union collapsed, the church underwent extensive reconstruction. It was reopened and restored to its original function as a center for Armenian religious life, continuing to serve as an important place of worship for Armenian community in Batumi.</p>
